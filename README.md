\📌 Project Overview

This project is a C-based Media Catalog System that efficiently stores, indexes, and searches large collections of media files using optimized data structures such as hash tables and inverted indexes.
It allows fast searching by title, artist, and genre while supporting sorting and persistent storage through file handling.

🎯 Objectives

Design an efficient media indexing and search system

Apply hashing and linked list concepts

Implement dynamic memory allocation

Provide fast search and sorting functionality

Build real-world experience with file I/O in C
